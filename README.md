# Exercise on Clean Coding Principles in C#
## From Pluralsight course by Cory House

Refactored code from the course's exercise files. Re-wrote the project before watching the refactoring steps presented on the course. 

It was my intention to see how my work measures up against the course's recommended refactoring step and "after" code. I also learn better doing an exercise on my own and compare it with the proposed solution, this kickstarts my problem solving skills. 

Also, I would love to hear feedback from the community on how I can improve my work. Feel free to give me a holler via Issues or Pull Requests. Thank you.
